This repository showcases the projects I have completed while working through the FreeCodeCamp certification tracks. The projects demonstrate core concepts of modern web development, including responsive layouts, semantic HTML, CSS Flexbox/Grid, accessibility practices, and interactive JavaScript functionality. Each project is organized in its own directory with source code and assets.

The goal of this repository is to track my growth as a developer and build a portfolio of clean, structured, and functional web projects.
